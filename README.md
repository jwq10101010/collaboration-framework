# collaboration-framework

## TODO: Create architecture diagram
How entities can collaborate with each other using Federated Wiki(s) + Open Source Auth Protocol(s):

### Government level
Each government entity has Internet Gateway -> Firewall -> Load Balancer -> Federated Wiki(s) placed in cluster, spread, or partition placement groups. These Federated Wikis can also act as the government entity's source of truth on certain matters such as legislation, rules of living in that particular society, etc.

### Local level
Each individual can decide to self-host a Federated Wiki server and collaborate on other wiki pages from all over the world on any topic available.
